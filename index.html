        <b>6. Interesting fact about me:</b> <br/>
            <p>I was born in Vietnam, but when I moved to the states, I lived in 4 different states (Arizona, Utah, Texas, and Oregon).  <br/>
                My family and I lived in 4 different states because we had families in those states. So, we lived in each states for about <br/>
                a year then towards the end of the years my parents decides if they like it. We started in Arizona, then went to Utah, <br/>
                after texas, and finally Portland. I've been in Portland ever since :> </p>
